The concept of object orientation is certainly one to admire.  Built on real life structures and relationships, it is easily both intuitive, and massively complex.  As it models from real life, I find it also lends a new perspective into real life.
When we begin to understand how object orientation works, and form a concept of how objects relate to and interact with each other its becomes natural to translate those concepts into our own lives and relationships, setting up a framework by which to analyse how we interact with others and vice versa.
Objects have different influences, relationships and interactions within thier spheres. Some objects carry great influence or authority within thier sphere and others play only a small part yet are essential.  The objects' interactions seem to produce the most dynamic and effective programming when designed to be fluid yet founded on firm logic.  If interactions between objects are brittle and thier relationships misunderstood, the program will be awkward and may easily break.
Our lives reflect this, though on a much more complex level.  One person can be many objects, a citizen of a nation, an employee or employer, a member of a family; and can influence and interact in many different spheres, such as his workplace, his community and his family.  We have different influences, interactions and levels of authority in these different spheres.  In our workplace we may be one thing to many people, a teacher, a mechanic, a programmer; whereas in our families we may be everything to a few people, such as a parent being the protector, provider, caregiver, teacher, chaufer, cook, etc.
Our core values and beliefs are the blueprints or design for how we as objects interact and relate to each other within our given spheres.  If these designs are rigid, weak, and founded on the shifting sands of faulty logic,  our relationships will be fragile and may easily break.  If what we allow to be the blueprints for our lives is life-giving and grounded on a logic that is solid and stable,  then our relationships stand a much better chance of being healthy and strong . . . And, our programs ARE. AWESOME.
